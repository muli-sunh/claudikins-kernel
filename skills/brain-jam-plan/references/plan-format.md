# Plan Output Format

Plans must follow this structure to be compatible with `claudikins-kernel:execute`.

## Required Sections

Every plan must include these sections in order:

### 1. Problem Statement

What problem are we solving? Be specific.

```markdown
## Problem Statement

Users cannot reset their passwords. When they click "Forgot Password",
nothing happens because the email service isn't configured.
```

### 2. Scope & Boundaries

What's IN scope and what's OUT.

```markdown
## Scope

### In Scope
- Password reset email functionality
- Reset token generation and validation
- Password update endpoint

### Out of Scope
- Password strength requirements (separate task)
- Rate limiting (future enhancement)
- SMS-based reset (not requested)
```

### 3. Success Criteria

Measurable conditions that define "done".

```markdown
## Success Criteria

- [ ] User can request password reset email
- [ ] Email arrives within 30 seconds
- [ ] Reset link expires after 1 hour
- [ ] User can set new password via link
- [ ] Old password no longer works after reset
```

### 4. Tasks

The work broken down into executable units.

**CRITICAL: Use the EXECUTION_TASKS markers exactly as shown.**

```markdown
## Tasks

<!-- EXECUTION_TASKS_START -->
| # | Task | Files | Deps | Batch |
|---|------|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | Add password reset token to schema | prisma/schema.prisma | - | 1 |
| 2 | Create reset token service | src/services/resetToken.ts | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | Add forgot-password endpoint | src/routes/auth.ts | 2 | 2 |
| 4 | Create reset-password endpoint | src/routes/auth.ts | 2 | 2 |
| 5 | Add email template | src/emails/passwordReset.tsx | - | 1 |
| 6 | Wire up email sending | src/services/email.ts | 5 | 2 |
| 7 | Add tests | src/tests/auth.test.ts | 3,4 | 3 |
<!-- EXECUTION_TASKS_END -->
```

**Column definitions:**

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| # | Task number (sequential) |
| Task | Single-sentence description |
| Files | Primary file(s) affected |
| Deps | Task numbers this depends on, or `-` for none |
| Batch | Execution batch (tasks in same batch can run in parallel) |

### 5. Dependencies

External dependencies and integration points.

```markdown
## Dependencies

### External
- Resend API for email sending (already configured)
- Prisma for database access

### Internal
- Existing User model
- Existing email service wrapper

### New
- None required
```

### 6. Risks & Mitigations

What could go wrong and how to handle it.

```markdown
## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Email delivery delays | Medium | Medium | Add retry logic, notify user of delay |
| Token collision | Low | High | Use UUID v4, check uniqueness |
| Brute force attacks | Medium | High | Rate limit endpoint (future task) |
```

### 7. Verification Checklist

How to verify the implementation works.

```markdown
## Verification

### Automated
- [ ] Unit tests for token service pass
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints pass
- [ ] Email template renders correctly

### Manual
- [ ] Request reset for existing user - email received
- [ ] Request reset for non-existent user - no email, no error shown
- [ ] Use valid token - password updated
- [ ] Use expired token - appropriate error shown
- [ ] Use invalid token - appropriate error shown
```

## File Naming

Save plans to: `.claude/plansclaudikins-kernel:plan-{session-id}.md`

Example: `.claude/plansclaudikins-kernel:plan-2026-01-16-1430.md`

## Machine-Readable Markers

The `<!-- EXECUTION_TASKS_START -->` and `<!-- EXECUTION_TASKS_END -->` markers are **required**. The `claudikins-kernel:execute` command parses these to extract the task table.

If markers are missing or malformed, `claudikins-kernel:execute` will fail with an error.
